As you change Terraform configurations, Terraform builds an execution plan that only modifies what is necessary to reach your desired state.

By using Terraform to change infrastructure, you can version control not only your configurations but also your state so you can see how the infrastructure evolved over time.

use provisioners to initialize instances when they're created.

#Failed Provisioners and Tainted Resources

If a resource successfully creates but fails during provisioning, Terraform will error and mark the resource as "tainted". A resource that is tainted has been physically created, but can't be considered safe to use since provisioning failed.

When you generate your next execution plan, Terraform will not attempt to restart provisioning on the same resource because it isn't guaranteed to be safe. Instead, Terraform will remove any tainted resources and create new resources, attempting to provision them again after creation.

Terraform also does not automatically roll back and destroy the resource during the apply when the failure happens, because that would go against the execution plan: the execution plan would've said a resource will be created, but does not say it will ever be deleted. If you create an execution plan with a tainted resource, however, the plan will clearly state that the resource will be destroyed because it is tainted.

Provisioners can also be defined that run only during a destroy operation. These are useful for performing system cleanup, extracting data, etc.

For many resources, using built-in cleanup mechanisms is recommended if possible (such as init scripts), but provisioners can be used if necessary
